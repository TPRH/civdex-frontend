#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
##### Day-to-Day Approach:
* ***Working Hours:***  9:00am-6:00pm
* ***Stand-up Meeting:*** 9:00am/2:00pm 
* ***(Scrum) - each morning, meet for 15-30 minutes regarding***
* ***Review - PM tool***
  * What they did the day prior
  * What they were having roadblocks on yesterday 
  * What they plan on doing today

* 9:30-12pm - Sprint - Remo/mic-off 
* 12pm-1:30pm - Lunch break
* 2:00 - Scrum
* 2:30-6pm - Sprint - Remo/mic-off 

#### Conflict Plan:
***Resolving Conflict:*** Addressing directly one-on-one is preferred.

***If someone is taking over the project:*** Bring it up during Scrum meeting, tell them what you are noticing

***If someone is not contributing enough:*** Ask them to step it up, ask if there is something they need to be 
successful (without judgement)

***If conflict needs escalating:*** Bring to group-level first, and if again that does not work, speak with JB about 
the issue.

#### Communication Plan:
* ***Hours of Availability:*** 9:00am - 6:00pm core hours
* ***Communication Platforms:*** Slack, Remo, Zoom
* ***Breaks:*** 12:00pm - 1:30pm lunch plus a 10-minute break on the hour
* ***Falling behind schedule:*** Mandatory overtime, or picking up others’ slack if possible and asking for help - 
  utilize 
  TA’s, other group members. Regroup and reevaluate scope if necessary (last resort). 
* ***After Hours/Weekend/Mics-Off Communication:*** Slack
* ***Voicing Concerns:*** Scrum meetings twice/day, remo/zoom working sessions
* ***Environment Safety:*** Accepting others for who they are, ensuring everyone has an opportunity to speak and feels 
  heard/like a contributor
* ***During sprints:***  If working individually and a question comes up, DM one (1) teammate instead of going 
  on-mic or messaging the whole group. If working with a TA, move to another table before submitting the ticket.
#### Work Plan:
* Task Identification/Assignment/Program Management: Notion program management tool, assign feature tasks to each 
  person.
* Pair programming: Pairing individuals with front end strength with back end strengths
